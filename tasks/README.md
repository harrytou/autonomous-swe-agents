# Tasks Directory

This directory contains PRDs and progress tracking for autonomous agent work.

## Files

- `{agent}_prd.json` - User stories and acceptance criteria for each agent
- `{agent}_progress.txt` - Learnings and context from completed iterations

## Format

See `.config/agent/project-manager.md` for PRD format specification.

## Lifecycle

1. PM creates PRD files when user requests a feature
2. Specialist agents read their PRD and work through stories
3. Agents update PRD (mark passes=true) and progress.txt as they work
4. PM monitors progress via these files
5. Files archived after feature completion
